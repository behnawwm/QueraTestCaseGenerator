# QueraTestCaseGenerator

Simple script which generates [Quera.ir](https://Quera.ir) test cases inside project folder directory by making a .zip file.

This script can be used by everyone who want to write their own test cases for their questions on Quera.


(Test cases are divided into 2 folders: `in` & `out` , and each folder follows { input1.txt , input2.txt , ... } || { output1.txt , output2.txt , ...} pattern )
